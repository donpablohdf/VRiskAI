# VRiskAI
VRiskAI is a application that uses virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and RFID and IoT technology to improve the safety and health of employees in the workplace, as well as to keep personnel informed of new laws and regulations.

## Features
• **Occupational risk training through virtual reality:**
The VRiskAI application will provide a virtual reality platform for employees to learn about occupational risks in a more interactive and effective way. We will use virtual reality technologies to recreate real situations of occupational hazards and simulate different scenarios where dangers can arise, the use of PPEs and other functionalities, offering a more immersive and effective learning experience. To achieve this, we will use virtual reality development tools such as Unity and Oculus.

• **Tests for evaluating and training in labor risks:**
In line with the VR training, the application will offer a series of tests for evaluating and training employees on labor risks and preventive measures. We will use technology for designing tests and evaluating risks to create questionnaires that cover the different topics of labor risks proposed by the safety manager. To do this, we will use tools for designing tests and evaluating risks such as SurveyMonkey.

• **Integration of artificial intelligence in all branches of the application:**
The integration of artificial intelligence in all branches of the VRiskAI application is one of its fundamental pillars. Through AI, the application will be able to learn from experience and data collected by sensors and other IoT devices. The AI will analyze the information and generate suggestions to improve occupational safety in different work areas.

In addition, the AI will periodically connect to databases and official websites to keep the occupational safety manager informed about new laws and regulations related to occupational safety. The AI will apply this new knowledge to everything it has learned from other sections of the application to suggest new modifications to the occupational safety manager's part of the application.

To achieve this, techniques of machine learning and natural language processing will be used. Python libraries will be employed to implement machine learning algorithms, such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Natural language processing libraries, such as NLTK and spaCy, will also be used.

The AI of VRiskAI will be designed with a modular and scalable approach, so it can adapt to the specific needs of each client. Deep learning techniques, neural networks, and image processing will be used for real-time data analysis. In this way, the AI will be able to detect behavior patterns and potential risks in work areas and generate real-time alerts to prevent occupational accidents.

• **Detection of generic and specific PPEs in work areas using RFID technology:** 
The application will use RFID technology to detect the presence of PPEs in work areas. RFID readers will be installed at the entrances of different work areas, and RFID tags will be placed on PPEs. This way, it will be possible to automatically detect whether employees are wearing the necessary PPEs in each area. For the implementation of this functionality, RFID technology such as Impinj and Python libraries such as PyRFID will be used.

• **Real-time monitoring of employee health through sensors integrated in PPEs:** 
The application will use sensors integrated in PPEs to monitor employees' health status in real-time. Different variables such as heart rate, body temperature, stress levels, among others, can be monitored. For the implementation of this functionality, IoT sensors such as Fitbit devices and Python libraries such as PySerial will be used.

• **Risk monitoring in work areas using sensors and IoT technology:** 
The application will use IoT sensors to monitor different variables in work areas that may represent an occupational hazard, such as noise levels, temperature, humidity, among others. For the implementation of this functionality, different IoT devices such as DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors, Adafruit noise sensors, among others, will be used.

• **Communication between employees and occupational risk managers through the application:**
The VRiskAI application will allow direct communication between employees and occupational risk managers through an integrated chat within the application. Employees will be able to send messages and photographs to report any situation that requires the attention of the occupational risk manager, such as a breakdown in personal protective equipment or the presence of a risk in the work area.

Occupational risk managers will be able to receive notifications immediately and respond to employee requests, indicating the measures to be taken in each situation or informing about the procedures to follow. In addition, occupational risk managers will have access to a control panel where they can see all requests and messages sent by employees, allowing them to have a global view of the state of safety in the company.

To ensure the privacy and confidentiality of communications, the application will have a data protection and security policy that complies with applicable regulations regarding personal data protection and cybersecurity. Of course, the AI will use these communications to advance its learning.
